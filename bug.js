This bug occurs when using the new React 19 features like `useSyncExternalStore` with legacy code or third-party libraries that don't correctly handle concurrent rendering updates.  It can lead to unexpected state updates and rendering inconsistencies, especially within complex component hierarchies involving asynchronous operations. The error manifests as incorrect UI updates or silent data corruption. Consider the following example where an external store's update doesn't trigger a re-render due to concurrent mode conflicts:

```javascript
import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';

function ExternalStore() {
  // ... (external store implementation using a non-React state mechanism)
}

function MyComponent() {
  const value = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getState, getSnapshot);
  return <div>{value}</div>;
}
```
