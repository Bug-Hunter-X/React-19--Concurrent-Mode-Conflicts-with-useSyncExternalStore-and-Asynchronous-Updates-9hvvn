# React 19 Concurrent Rendering Bug with useSyncExternalStore

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur in React 19 when using `useSyncExternalStore` with legacy code or third-party libraries. The problem arises from conflicts between concurrent rendering and the update mechanisms of external stores.  This can result in incorrect UI updates or silent data corruption.

## Bug Description

The bug manifests when an external store's update doesn't correctly trigger a re-render in a component using `useSyncExternalStore`.  This is especially problematic in complex component trees or when asynchronous operations are involved.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Observe the unexpected UI behavior.  The counter might not always update correctly due to concurrent mode interfering with external store updates.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully managing the external store's update process to ensure it interacts correctly with React's concurrent mode.  This often requires adapting the store's internal mechanisms or using additional techniques to explicitly trigger updates and handle potential race conditions. See the `bugSolution.js` for a more robust implementation.
